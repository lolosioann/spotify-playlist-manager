# Spotify Playlist Manager

## Overview
Spotify Playlist Manager is a website designed to help users manage their Spotify playlists efficiently. With this tool, you can create, update, delete, and organize your playlists with ease.

## Features
**STILL UNDER DEVELOPMENT**

This Project Uses Flask for rendering the website and connects to the spotify API in order to read playlist data it needs.
Haven't started working on the Frontend yet. Might also add some database functionality later
